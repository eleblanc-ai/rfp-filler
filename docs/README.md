![starry background with colorful clouds](/img/readme-cover.png)

Cosmo is a development identity for **Claude Code**. Use this GitHub template to start each project in its own repo. Open it in Claude Code, say `cosmo start` — and Claude becomes a disciplined dev partner. It interviews you to write a spec, then builds your app in slices: focused, self-contained units of work, each built with tests and approved by you before the next one begins.

**Requires Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI agent). Also works with GitHub Copilot agent mode in VS Code when Claude is selected as the agent.

## How it works

Cosmo runs a 4-phase loop, repeating until you decide your product is complete.

```
Phase 1: Interview   →  Write the spec together
Phase 2: Plan        →  Scope the next slice
Phase 3: Implement   →  Build it, test it, verify it
Phase 4: Approval    →  Review, approve, or iterate
```

Each slice is a single focused increment — one feature, one concern, one thing you can review and approve in a conversation. Before a slice is recorded as done, it must pass tests, build successfully, and pass manual verification steps you perform in the browser. Nothing is committed to your slice history until you approve it. State is saved to `.state/` between sessions, so Cosmo always picks up exactly where you left off — mid-interview, mid-plan, or mid-implementation.

Optionally, Cosmo can initialize your project as a GitHub repo and commit after every approved slice, giving you a clean history of exactly what was built and when.

*Currently optimized for React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. Support for additional stacks is planned.*

## Getting started

Cosmo runs inside an AI coding agent using project instructions.

**1. Create your project from the template**

```bash
gh repo create my-project --template eleblanc-ai/cosmo --clone --private
```

This creates a fresh repo in your GitHub account with a clean history and clones it locally.

**2. Open in Claude Code**

Open your cloned folder in Claude Code (`claude` in your terminal from that directory). GitHub Copilot agent mode in VS Code with Claude selected also works.

**3. Start a session**

The template includes a `CLAUDE.md` file that Claude Code reads automatically when it loads your project. When you're ready, say:

```
cosmo start
```

Cosmo checks for saved state and picks up exactly where you left off, or starts Phase 1 if you're new.

**4. Pause and resume**

```
pause cosmo
```

Cosmo saves its phase context so the next session resumes without losing anything. To restart after pausing:

```
cosmo start
```

## Workspace structure

Each workspace holds exactly one project. Project files live at the root alongside the `cosmo-instructions/` framework folder.

```
my-project/
├── cosmo-instructions/                 ← Cosmo framework (read-only)
│   ├── cosmo.md           ← Identity instructions
│   ├── workflow.md        ← The 4-phase loop
│   ├── architecture.md    ← Universal architecture principles
│   ├── templates.md       ← Document templates

├── src/                   ← Your app (scaffolded at first slice)

```

Cosmo never edits framework files. To start a new project, clone a fresh copy of this template.

**Framework files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cosmo.md` | Startup instructions and identity definition |
| `workflow.md` | The 4-phase loop: Interview → Plan → Implement → Approval |
| `architecture.md` | Architecture principles applied to all generated code |
| `templates.md` | Templates for plans, state files, and slice records |
| `stacks/` | Stack-specific rules (currently: React + Vite + Supabase) |
| `VERSION` | Current version — checked at startup to detect updates |

---

## Updating Cosmo

Cosmo checks for updates at the start of each session and prompts you to apply them. If an update is available and you say yes, Cosmo downloads the new framework files, updates `VERSION`, and commits the change to your workspace.

---

## Example session

```
You:    cosmo start
Cosmo:  Update available (your version: 1.2, latest: 1.3). Update now? (yes/no)

You:    yes
Cosmo:  Updated. Phase 1: Interview — Writing spec
        Tell me about the product you want to build.

You:    A flashcard app. Create decks, flip through cards, track what you know.
Cosmo:  Got it. A few questions to sharpen the spec...
        [interviews you, writes spec.md]
        Does this spec capture your vision? (yes/no)

You:    yes
Cosmo:  Phase 2: Plan — Scoping next slice
        [reads spec, examines codebase, proposes Slice 1]
        Approve this plan? (yes/no)

You:    yes
Cosmo:  Phase 3: Implement — Building and verifying
        [builds, tests, verifies]
        Phase 4: Approval — Presenting slice
        All 9 tests pass. Here's what was built...

        Manual verification:
        [ ] npm run dev → app loads without errors
        [ ] Create a new deck — it appears in the list of decks
        [ ] Add a card to the deck — card count updates

        Approve this slice? (yes/no)

You:    yes
Cosmo:  Phase 2: Plan...
```

Saying **no** at any step keeps you in the loop:

- **No to update** — skips the update and continues the session as-is.
- **No to spec** — Cosmo asks what's off and keeps refining until you're satisfied.
- **No to plan** — Cosmo asks what to change and revises the slice proposal.
- **No to slice** — Cosmo asks what needs to change, goes back to Phase 3 to fix it, then presents the full updated slice for approval again.
